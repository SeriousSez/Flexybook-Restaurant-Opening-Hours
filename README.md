## 📋 Assignment Overview & Feature Summary

This project was developed as part of a .NET Developer job application assignment for FlexyBox ApS. The goal was to implement a Blazor application based on a provided Figma design ([Figma link](https://www.figma.com/design/BPYVMBj1ZgYK2U4gp218HU/Flexybook---DevTest?node-id=1-10282&t=Lod4mSn7BonpPL63-4)), without using component libraries or CSS frameworks, to demonstrate creativity and problem-solving in UI implementation.

### Implemented Features (per requirements)

- **Custom Blazor components**: All UI elements were built from scratch, matching the Figma design as closely as possible without component libraries or CSS frameworks.
- **Restaurant listing and details**: Browse all restaurants, view details, contact info, and opening hours for multiple service types.
- **Favorites system**: Mark/unmark restaurants as favorites, persisted per user.
- **Responsive design**: Fully responsive layout for both desktop and mobile, closely following the Figma mobile and desktop views.
- **Tab navigation**: Switch between different opening hour types (Restaurant, Takeaway, Buffet, Special Events) with swipeable tabs.
- **Image gallery**: Horizontal scrollable image gallery with mouse wheel and touch support.
- **Authentication**: Login/logout flow with seeded user, using ASP.NET Core Identity (no credentials required for demo login).
- **Skeleton loaders**: Smooth loading states for data fetches, matching the Figma design.
- **Error handling**: Custom 404 page for invalid routes.
- **In-memory database**: Entity Framework Core with demo data seeding for rapid prototyping.
- **Clean architecture**: Domain, Infrastructure, ApplicationService, and UI layers for maintainability and testability.

### Enhancements Beyond Requirements

> **Tip:** To view the mobile layout, open your browser's developer tools (usually F12 or right-click → Inspect), then toggle the device toolbar (often the phone/tablet icon) and select a mobile device.

> **Note:** I attempted to implement a feature that would allow users to preview the mobile layout directly in the browser (e.g., via a toggle or button), but this is not reliably possible. Browsers do not allow you to programmatically change the viewport or user agent in a way that fully simulates a mobile device. The only accurate way to view the mobile layout is by using the device emulation tools built into browser developer tools.

A modern web application for displaying restaurant information, opening hours, contact details, and image galleries. Built with Blazor Server and ASP.NET Core Identity.

## 📖 About The Project

Flexybook is a restaurant management application that allows users to browse multiple restaurant locations, view detailed information including opening hours for different service types (restaurant, takeaway, buffet, special events), and manage their favorite restaurants. The application features automatic authentication, responsive design, and an intuitive user interface.

### Why This Architecture?

**Clean Architecture Pattern**: The project is structured into three main layers:

- **Flexybook.Domain**: Contains entities, responses, and business models
- **Flexybook.Infrastructure**: Handles data access with Entity Framework Core and repositories
- **Flexybook.ApplicationService**: Contains business logic and service layer
- **Flexybook**: Presentation layer with Blazor components

This separation ensures maintainability, testability, and follows Single Responsibility Principle throughout the codebase.

**In-Memory Database**: Uses Entity Framework Core with in-memory database for quick development and demonstration purposes. Perfect for prototyping without needing a full database setup.

**JWT Authentication**: Although this is a demo app with auto-login, JWT tokens are implemented to demonstrate proper authentication patterns that could be extended to a full user management system.

## 🚧 Development Journey & Challenges

### Development Time

This project was developed over **approximately 22 hours** across 2 days (January 7-8, 2026) with **26 commits**.

**Actual Coding Time:** ~18-19 hours (accounting for breaks, meals, dog walks, etc.)

**Timeline Breakdown:**

**Day 1 (January 7):**

- 10:00-15:30 (~5.5 hrs) - Initial development and experimentation
- 15:30-16:09 (~40 min) - Project setup and component division
- 16:09-18:41 (~2.5 hrs) - Backend architecture (repositories, services, EF Core)
- 18:41-21:58 (~3 hrs) - Core functionality (data binding, tabs, favorites system)
- 21:58-03:49 (~6 hrs) - Major styling overhaul and responsive design

**Day 2 (January 8):**

- 03:49-05:30 (~1.5 hrs) - Base64 image handling and ASP.NET Core Identity
- 05:30-08:04 (~2.5 hrs) - Skeleton loaders, image compression, and comprehensive refactoring

Major phases included removing Bootstrap entirely, implementing custom authentication, adding skeleton loaders, and refactoring the entire backend for clean architecture.

### Key Challenges Faced

#### 1. **Blazor Render Modes**

**Problem**: Components weren't interactive - buttons didn't work, state wasn't updating.

**Solution**: Learned that Blazor Server requires `@rendermode InteractiveServer` attribute on components or pages that need interactivity. This was a frequent stumbling block as a Blazor beginner.

```razor
@rendermode InteractiveServer
```

#### 2. **Authentication Timing Issues**

**Problem**: Skeleton loaders were disappearing before authentication completed, showing empty states briefly.

**Solution**: Used `OnAfterRenderAsync` with a `firstRender` flag to ensure authentication check completed before hiding loading states. The timing of Blazor lifecycle methods was initially confusing.

#### 3. **Image Loading Performance**

**Problem**: Base64-encoded images stored in the database caused very slow initial loads.

**Solution**: Identified this as a performance bottleneck. In production, this would be replaced with file storage or CDN. Trade-off for demo simplicity vs. real-world performance.

#### 4. **Component Lifecycle**

**Problem**: `OnInitializedAsync` was being called multiple times, making state management confusing.

**Solution**: Learned to track initialization state and use `OnAfterRenderAsync` for operations that need to wait for DOM to be ready, especially when calling JavaScript.

#### 5. **CSS Scoping**

**Problem**: Styles were leaking between components or not applying at all.

**Solution**: Blazor's scoped CSS (`.razor.css` files) automatically scopes styles to components. Had to learn when to use scoped vs. global styles.

#### 6. **JavaScript Interop**

**Problem**: Calling JavaScript functions from Blazor and passing element references was initially unclear.

**Solution**: Used `ElementReference` and `IJSRuntime` to enable custom scroll behavior. Learning curve around when JS is available and how to pass DOM references.

#### 7. **Entity Framework Change Tracking**

**Problem**: Update operations were failing due to EF tracking already-loaded entities.

**Solution**: Implemented proper detachment of tracked entities before updates. Understanding EF's change tracker was critical.

### What Would I Do Differently?

1. **Start with proper image storage** instead of Base64 encoding
2. **Use Blazor WebAssembly** for better client-side interactivity (if offline capability wasn't needed)
3. **Add unit tests early** rather than as an afterthought
4. **Set up logging from the start** for better debugging
5. **Use a real database** with migrations instead of in-memory for understanding data persistence better

### Lessons Learned

- **Blazor Lifecycle is crucial**: Understanding when components render and re-render is fundamental
- **Separation of Concerns matters**: Refactoring to clean architecture made the code much more maintainable
- **User feedback is essential**: Loading states and error handling dramatically improve UX
- **Mobile-first responsive design**: Mobile layout was implemented first, ensuring a great experience on all devices
- **Documentation as you go**: Writing XML comments while coding is easier than adding them later

## 📝 Code Quality

### Recent Refactoring

The codebase underwent comprehensive cleanup following best practices:

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Methods split by concern
- **XML Documentation**: All public APIs documented
- **Repository Pattern**: Consistent data access
- **Service Layer**: Clean business logic separation
- **Component Organization**: Pages, Shared, and Layout properly separated
- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Reusable helpers and utilities

### Standards Applied

- Async/await throughout
- Dependency injection
- XML documentation comments
- Consistent naming conventions
- Separation of concerns
- Clean architecture principles

## 🧩 Service Usage Pattern in Blazor Server

In this project, Razor components (pages) call application and domain services directly via dependency injection. This is considered best practice for Blazor Server applications because:

- The code runs on the server, so components have direct access to backend services and data.
- It simplifies the architecture and avoids unnecessary HTTP calls or API layers.
- Dependency injection ensures services are testable and maintainable.

**When should you use API endpoints instead?**

- If you plan to support other clients (e.g., mobile apps, external web apps) that need to access your backend.
- If you want to decouple the UI from the backend for future flexibility or scalability.
- In Blazor WebAssembly (client-side), where the client cannot access server-side services directly and must use HTTP APIs.

For this Blazor Server project, direct service injection is efficient and idiomatic. If the application evolves to support multiple frontends, introducing API endpoints would be recommended.
